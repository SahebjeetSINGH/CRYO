# CRYO





# Problem Statement :-

  Increasing ticket fraud and broker.



# Inspiration :- 
  The current ticket system is still vulnerable to fraud by brokers. The brokers resell the tickets they have bought to potential buyers at a price that is quite high     when compared to the original price. This forces people to spend a lot of money on the tickets for their desired event.



# Solution :- 
  As a solution to the problem of circulating ticket fraud and brokers, we created CRYO. CRYO was created as a web application-based product on software that utilises     blockchain technology to purchase NFT-based event tickets so that it can provide security and ease of purchasing tickets online. With CRYO, all event tickets purchased   by users will be in the form of NFT, so that the authenticity of the ticket is proven to be valid because all data contained in the blockchain can be seen by the owner   and historical data on the ownership of the NFT. Aside from being an identity marker, the event organiser can also customise the shape of the NFT that will be sold so   that it can become a unique souvenir for visitors to commemorate the event. To prevent corruption in event ticket sales, we also present a feature for sharing sales     results with event stakeholders by the percentage determined by the organisers.
